This game was made in 2022 for the adventure jam by @yolowex
It is written in C++/SDL2.

The code and the art are both created by me (except for the fish which I googled and modified &&
and the lazy font which was downloaded from lazyfoo.net).

I was planing to add 3 more levels (behind the ending doors),
but unfortunatly my semester exams are just about to start and I had to publish this before 
the game jam deadline. (4 days sooner).

It was my very first project and I was soooo happy to concentrate on this project for 10 straight days.

TNX for playing , Feel free to peek at the source code at "github.com/maxqxam/SDL2_Advanced"
